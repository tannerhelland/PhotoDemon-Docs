# Getting started

Getting started with PhotoDemon takes less than 60 seconds - and that's if you have a slow Internet connection!  (For many users, getting started takes less time than reading this *Getting started* page.)

To get started with PhotoDemon you just need to [download the version you want from photodemon.org](https://photodemon.org/download/), then extract the contents of your downloaded file to their own folder on your PC.  Once that's done, click on `PhotoDemon.exe` to begin!

For beginners, detailed walkthroughs of each step are available below.
