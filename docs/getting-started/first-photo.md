## Edit your first photo

Now that you've gotten PhotoDemon up and running, it's time to have some fun!

## Load a photo into the program

One of the central themes in PhotoDemon is *there's no **one** right way to do things*.  There are many different ways to use the program, and you are welcome to use whatever works best for you.

This starts with how you load images into the program for editing.  Here are some ways to do this:

1) The `File > Open` menu
2) The `File > Import` menu, with options for scanning images, importing them from the Internet, taking screenshots, and more
3) Dragging files from somewhere like Windows Explorer and dropping them onto an open PhotoDemon window
4) Before you even start PhotoDemon, you can drag image files onto the `PhotoDemon.exe` icon and the program will start up, then load the dropped files automatically
5) The `Edit > Paste to new image` menu is also an option, if you've already copied files or images in another app

All of these options work interchangeably, and you can switch between them at any time.
